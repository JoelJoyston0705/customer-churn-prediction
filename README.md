## customer-churn-prediction
A machine learning project to predict customer churn based on behavior and demographic data. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), evaluation metrics, and insights to help businesses improve retention strategies.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: [Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Features: Gender, Tenure, Services, Charges, etc.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## ðŸš€ Approach
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC)

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Best Model: Random Forest (Accuracy ~85%)
- Key Factors: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Internet Service
